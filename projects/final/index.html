    <h3>THE DRONE WARS: UNDERSTANDING DRONES AND FUTURE IMPLICATIONS</h3>
        <p>Drones, otherwise known as unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), have demanded military attention over the past two decades due to the innovation’s impressive battlefield capability in counterterrorism efforts. As the new face of warfare, drones have become more lethal, more secretive, and less transparent. Here’s what you need to know.
        </p> 
</div>


<!-- First Paragraph -->
<div class="section-two">
    <h3>WHAT ARE DRONES?</h3>
        <p>Drones, according to military experts, provide on-the-ground 24-hour bird’s eye surveillance without having to put military boots onsite. In addition to collecting real-time visual data, many different types of drones have the ability to conduct extreme precision strikes against targets on the ground without requiring any other sort of military intrusion. As some military experts and foreign policy analysts hold reverence for UAVs, others are more concerned about the ethical and legal implications of the weapons. </p>

        <p>Ryan Fletcher, a research associate with the Conventional Defense Program at the Stimson Center, believes that while certain types of militarized weapons are inherently problematic on legal and ethical grounds, drones aren’t necessarily unethical.</p> 

        <p>“Drones are a weapons platform which can be deployed ethically and lawfully or unethically and unlawfully,” said Fletcher. “However, drones have unique attributes which set them apart from other systems, and which arguably make it easier for them to be used unethically and/or unlawfully.” </p>

        <p>Lawrence Lewis, vice president and director of the Center for Autonomy and Artificial Intelligence at CNA, also says that drones have both strengths and weaknesses depending on how they are used.</p>

        <p>“Drones have been part of the successful counterterrorism efforts in Iraq and Afghanistan. But they were only a part of a larger program that also included special forces on the ground, detainee operations obtaining actionable intelligence, and a dedicated targeting cycle that built on ongoing operations. Using drones in this larger process helped to best put the strengths of drones to good use while reducing the impact of their weaknesses,” said Lewis. “When the U.S. has emphasized drones more on their own, to both develop and then attack targets, the results have been marked with outcomes such as civilian casualties." </p>

<!-- Second Paragraph -->
<div class="col-md-6">
<div class="section-three">
    <h3>HOW ARE DRONES USED?</h3>
        <p>Due to the U.S. government’s secrecy surrounding the nature of drone strikes and the inefficiency that is present when identifying strike victims, the real number of civilians and children killed are varied and blurred across different reports.  

        <p>“Obviously there’s the physical and emotional harm caused to victims and their friends and family, but there’s also the persistent fear of the next strike that everyone in the community has to live with, which I imagine is severely traumatizing,” said Fletcher.</p>

        <p>According to the Bureau of Investigative Journalism, Afghanistan oversaw the most strikes since President Trump took office compared to Somalia and Yemen. A total of 11,766 minimum confirmed strikes were recorded in Afghanistan while 173 were documented in Yemen and 161 in Somalia. More than 7,000 individuals, including children and civilians, were killed in Afghanistan from drone strikes since 2017.
        </p>

        <p>Not only do drones physically harm local civilian populations, but according to Lewis, they can contribute to psychological scars as well.</p>

        <p>“They can also have psychological effects on local populations, who can be haunted by the risk of attacks from platforms they cannot see, or sometimes ones they claim to see or hear,” said Lewis.</p>

    <h3> A DRONES ARMS RACE</h3>
        <p>According to Fortune Business Insights, the global unmanned aerial vehicle market size was valued at $10.72 billion in 2019 and is projected to reach $25.13 billion by 2027. Drones and UAV technology has enhanced the productivity of the military in recent years and has been deployed for a variety of reasons such as security monitoring, surveillance, and logistics.

        <p>With the growing demand for intelligence, security, and reconnaissance assets, the U.S. has also been a key player in selling weapons overseas. In recent months, the Trump administration has notified Congress of its approval to sell up to 18 MQ-9 Reapers to the United Arab Emirates. Produced by General Atomics, these weapons are highly lethal “hunter-killer” drones designed for longer endurance and high altitude surveillance that can also carry hellfire missiles and Joint Direct Attack Munition.</p>

        <p>The Trump administration had also recently approved a $600 million drone sale to Taiwan just last month in order to ramp up pressure on China. According to Fletcher, the current administration has loosened its drone export rules and has pushed to expand armed drone exports to its allies in order to support the U.S. weapons industry. “These sales are not only problematic in and of themselves since the sales to Taiwan and India could inflame tensions with China, while the sales to the UAE could facilitate further human rights abuses and war crimes, but they are also setting a dangerous precedent for other drone producing states looking to expand its international sales,” said Fletcher.</p>

        <p>Lewis said the market is inevitably going to expand as more and more nations view the market as a viable avenue for business.</p>

    <h3>LONG-TERM IMPLICATIONS</h3>
        <p>According to Fortune Business Insights, the global military drone market is projected to grow from $10.53 billion in 2019 to $23.78 billion by 2027 due to the rise of procurement of UAVs by larger defense forces worldwide. With growing trends towards heightened drone usage, it’s too early to tell what changes the new upcoming administration will implement following four years of limited transparency on drone policy and minimal congressional oversight. 

        <p>“The U.S. has long been the most prolific user of armed drones and in that respect is setting a lot of precedents for other states to follow. With armed drones proliferating at an alarming rate, it’s incumbent on the United States to set a responsible example,” said Fletcher.</p>
